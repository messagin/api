# Installation

<!-- ### ***Important Note***: Those installation instructions were written for *Debian-based Linux* systems. No official installation guides for other systems will be provided here. -->

<!-- ## Step 1: Disk Configuration
To store message attachments, Messagin' requires a separate partition `/messagin-data`. Below are the steps to set up that partition. [Skip to step 2](#step-2-configuring-scylladb) if you already have it.

## Step 2: Configuring ScyllaDB

## Step 3: Installing Node.JS
We suggest you use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.JS installation. Please follow their [installation guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) first. The current Messagin' API uses Node version `22.x`. Run `nvm install v22` to install it.

## Step 4: Cloning Messagin'
Run the following commands to clone and download the required packages. Note that Messagin' uses the `yarn` package manager which we recommended over NPM, you are however free to use any package manager you want at your own risk.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/messagin/api.git
cd api
npm install -g yarn # skip if you have yarn installed
yarn install
```

## Step 4: Running and connecting
You can start Messagin' by running `yarn dev`. By default, Messagin' uses the 4000 port, you can change that by running it with `PORT=X yarn dev` (where `X` is your desired port), or you can add `PORT=X` to the `.env` file.

To connect to Messagin', you will need a client. You can either build a custom one or use one from this list:
